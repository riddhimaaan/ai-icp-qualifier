Scrape the website content, then decide if this company is a qualified prospect.\n\n## QUALIFIED PROSPECT DEFINITION\nA company qualifies if it operates in ONE OR MORE of these categories:\n- Cold email software (sending infrastructure, deliverability, warmup)\n- Cold LinkedIn outreach tools\n- Lead generation data / prospecting databases\n- Sales engagement platforms\n- Email finding / contact enrichment\n- AI-powered outreach automation\n- Inbox / reply management for outreach\n- Lead qualification or scoring tools\n\nReference companies to calibrate your judgment: Smartlead, Instantly, Clay, Prospeo, Heyreach, Apollo, Lemlist, La Growth Machine, Hunter.io, Dropcontact, Snov.io, Expandi, Waalaxy.\n\n## DISQUALIFY IF\n- B2C product (sells to individuals, not businesses)\n- Marketing automation for paid ads (Google Ads, Meta Ads — NOT outreach)\n- CRM software with no outreach component (pure pipeline management)\n- Content marketing / SEO tools\n- Social media scheduling tools\n- HR, finance, legal, or operations SaaS\n- The product is in stealth / no clear product description found\n\n## SCORING RUBRIC (1-10)\nScore based on how closely the company matches the ICP:\n\n9-10 = Core cold outreach or lead gen infrastructure (direct competitor to Smartlead, Clay, Instantly)\n7-8 = Adjacent tool used by cold outreach teams (enrichment, inbox management, sequence tools)\n5-6 = Partial fit — has outreach features but it's not the core product\n3-4 = Weak fit — B2B SaaS but outreach is a minor feature\n1-2 = Wrong category but still B2B SaaS\n0 = B2C or no clear product\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\nReturn ONLY a valid JSON object. No explanation outside the JSON.\n\n{\n  \"url\": \"the input URL\",\n  \"verdict\": \"QUALIFY or DISQUALIFY\",\n  \"score\": \"number 1-10\",\n  \"reason\": \"2-3 sentences. State exactly what the product does, which category it fits or fails, and the specific reason for your score. No vague language.\"\n}\n\n## RULES\n- If there is no content or an error, set verdict to DISQUALIFY, score to 0, reason to \"Website inaccessible or no product description found.\"\n- Do not infer or guess what a product does. Base judgment only on what the scraped website content returns.\n- Do not return anything outside the JSON object."
